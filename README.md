# A remake of my Cardgames.org project using React

This project is a remake of a previous project called cardgame-node.
That website was a collection of different card games with different online features that included:

- Logins
- A leaderboard
- Online play

This project looks to recreate that project using React and the Mern stack.
I hope to redo all features present in the original project.

Verious different card games are featured here:

- Blackjack
- Snip Snap Snorum
- Crazy Eights
- Matching
- Go Fish
- Spider Solitare
- War
